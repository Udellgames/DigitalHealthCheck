The tests in the project are for automatic HTML conformation tests against Government Design System (GDS) fixtures.
To add a new GDS component and its fixtures to be tested, complete the following steps:

1) Add a Linked File Reference in this project under Fixtures/<componentName>/ to the GDS component's fixture.json file. This can be found at <solutionRoot>\DigitalHealthCheckWeb\node_modules\govuk-frontend\govuk\components\<componentName>\fixtures.json
2) In the Linked File properties, set Build Action to None, and Copy To Output Directory to Copy Always
3) Create a subclass of ComponentFactory<T> in the Factories folder and implemnent the abstract method AssignParameters. Use the ButtonFactory class as a reference.
4) Open ComponentTests.cs and add a new line to the `fixtures` Dictionary at the top of the file. The format should be { "componentName", new ComponentFactory() } Make sure "componentName" matches the name of the folder you created under Fixtures/ in this project. For ComponentFactory, use the new subclass of ComponentFactory you just wrote.
5) Rebuild and run all tests, the new component's fixtures should be automatically loaded and added as individual tests to the test explorer.
