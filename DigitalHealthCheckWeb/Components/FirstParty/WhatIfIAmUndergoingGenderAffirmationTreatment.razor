<GDSDetails SummaryText="If you have undergone or are undergoing gender affirmation treatment, please read the information below.">
    <p class="govuk-body">Some individuals may choose to pursue medical transition through gender-affirming care. Medical transition is a medical process that may include the use of hormone therapy, and/or a number of surgeries. Not all trans people will pursue a medical transition, while others may pursue hormone therapy without surgery or surgery without hormones.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">For the purposes of this NHS Health Check, when we ask about gender affirmation treatment, we are focusing on medical interventions that affect your hormones, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), hormone blockers, hysterectomy and orchiectomy.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">There is limited research as to whether undergoing gender-affirmation treatments has an impact on your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease, or Type 2 diabetes.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">There is currently not enough research to give a precise risk score based on the type and duration of your gender affirmation treatment. The research available suggests that your risk will change from your sex assigned at birth and move towards your current gender identity over time. You may wish to view results for both your sex assigned at birth and your current gender identity, because your individual results are likely to be between the two. Results are close approximations, with generally only a 5% difference between risk scores for your current gender identity and your sex assigned at birth.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You will be given the option to view both results. You can decide which you would like to see first, and whether you would like to view the second set. In any case, we recognise and respect your current gender identity.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You may want to follow up with a healthcare provider, including someone at your GP clinic, an endocrine or gender identity team (if you are able to access one), or one of the specialist services recommended by trans and non-binary communties such as Dean Street, CliniQ, or the Beaumont Society.</p>
