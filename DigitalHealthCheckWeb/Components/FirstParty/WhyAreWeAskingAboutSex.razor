<GDSDetails SummaryText="Why are we asking about sex assigned at birth?">
    <p class="govuk-body">Information about sex assigned at birth, in combination with other personalised factors, is used to calculate your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, it is not possible to calculate your risk without this information.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Sex is based not only on the genes we inherit, but also on how our external and internal sex and reproductive organs work and respond to hormones.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Hormones are chemical messengers that the endocrine glands produce and release into the bloodstream. Hormones help regulate many bodily processes, such as appetite, sleep and growth.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The sex hormones are testosterone, progesterone and estrogen. Sex hormones are important for a range of bodily functions and a person’s general health. You are likely to have different levels of sex hormones depending on your sex assigned at birth. These hormonal differences can influence your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">One of the limitations of the medical device algorithms, which are used to calculate the risk of heart and circulatory disease, as well as Type 2 diabetes, is that these algorithms only allow for binary sex options. Therefore, only ‘male’ or ‘female’ options can be selected for sex assigned at birth.</p>
